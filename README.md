pySim-prog - Utility for programmable SIM/USIM-Cards (Costumized for our cards)
==============================================================================

This repository contains a Python-language program that can be used
to program (write) certain fields/parameters on so-called programmable
SIM/USIM cards.

Such SIM/USIM cards are special cards, which - unlike those issued by
regular commercial operators - come with the kind of keys that allow you
to write the files/fields that normally only an operator can program.

This is useful particularly if you are running your own cellular
network, and want to issue your own SIM/USIM cards for that network.
